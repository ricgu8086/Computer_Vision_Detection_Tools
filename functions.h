	//This is the Tomasz Malisiewicz's version of Non-Maximum Suppression based on Pedro Felzenszwalb's version

	//It acts exactly as if we use a=max(tresh, b) in Matlab, if there are values lower than tresh in the list
	//automatically are changed to tresh value
	inline vector <int> maxMatlab (int tresh, vector<int> list);

	//It acts exactly as if we use a=min(tresh, b) in Matlab, if there are values greater than tresh in the list
	//automatically are changed to tresh value
	inline vector <int> minMatlab (int tresh, vector<int> list);

	//It performs the operation first(i)-second(i)+scalar. If we didn't provide any scalar, it will only substract second from first
	vector <int> subsVector (vector<int> &first, vector<int> &second, int scalar=0);

	//If we execute [b c] = sort(a) in Matlab, the returned variable b would content the position each element
	//has before being sorted. This function behaves similar, but only returns b, not c.
	//It sorts the elements in ascending order -> source={9, 5, 1, 6}, destination={1, 5, 6, 9}
